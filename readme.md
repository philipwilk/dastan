# Task 2        Marks: 4

This question refers to the CreateMoveOptionOffer, CreateMoveOption and CreateMoveOptions methods and creation of a new method CreateFarisMoveOption in the Dastan class.

Develop a new move option called a ‘Faris’ (Knight). The Faris move option moves similarly to a knight in chess – either two squares forward/backwards and one square left/right or oppositely two squares left/right and one square forward/backwards. You should demonstrate the use of the Direction parameter.

## What you need to do

## Task 1

- Add new functionality into the CreateMoveOptionOffer & CreateMoveOption methods to perform a Faris move.
- Modify the CreateMoveOptions method to add the Faris after the Ryott for both players.
- Create a new method CreateFarisMoveOption which adds moves using the pattern shown, to the NewMoveOption object    .

## Task 2

Test that the changes you have made work:

- run the skeleton program.
- play two turns, showing both players making legal Faris moves.
