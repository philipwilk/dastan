# Task 1        Marks: 2

This question refers to the Dastan class.
Introduce new functionality at the point at which both players are instantiated that allows players to have custom names set by the users. Ensure that players cannot both have the same name. This code will replace the two lines that currently create the players with a single call to a new private method, CreateCustomPlayers.

## What you need to do

## Task 1

    Create a new method CreateCustomPlayers in the Dastan class. Allow the user to enter custom names for each player. Include checks in your code to ensure that two players cannot have the same custom name.
Allow the first player to enter any name they like, then repeatedly ask the user for the second player name until they are both different.

## Task 2

Test that the changes you have made work:

- run the skeleton program.
- enter ‘Tom’ as the first player name and then enter ‘Tom’ as the second player name, when re-prompted, enter ‘Tom’ again and then at the next prompt, enter ‘Victoria’.
- show the game using one of the custom names to address the player in the main game menu.
